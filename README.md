A comprehensive framework for optimizing Factorio factory layouts using SMT solvers and advanced pathfinding algorithms. This project applies formal methods to solve the complex problem of factory design automation, achieving up to 97x performance improvements over previous approaches.

## üéØ Overview

This project tackles the challenging problem of automated factory layout optimization in Factorio, with applications extending to real-world logistics and manufacturing systems. The solution combines:

- **SMT Solver Integration**: Uses Z3, CVC5, and Yices for constraint satisfaction
- **Advanced Pathfinding**: Multi-agent pathfinding for belt and pipe routing
- **Interactive Web Interface**: FastAPI-based web application for easy use
- **Blueprint Generation**: Automatic Factorio blueprint creation
- **Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive solver evaluation and benchmarking

4. **Configure solver paths** in `solver_eval.py`:

```python
CVC5_PATH = "path/to/cvc5.exe"
YICES_PATH = "path/to/yices-smt2.exe"
```

5. **Run the application**:

```bash
python main.py
```

The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## üéÆ Usage

### Web Interface

1. **Access the application**: Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
2. **Production Tree Generator**: Create single module blueprints
3. **Factory Builder**: Build complex multi-module factories
4. **Solver Evaluation**: Compare solver performance

### Command Line Interface

```python
from FactorioProductionTree import FactorioProductionTree

# Create a factory for producing electronic circuits
factory = FactorioProductionTree(width=20, height=15)
production_data = factory.calculate_production("electronic-circuit", 60)

# Set up manual I/O points
factory.manual_Input()
factory.manual_Output()

# Optimize layout
factory.solve(production_data, solver_type="z3")

# Generate blueprint
paths, inserters = factory.build_belts()
factory.create_blueprint("output.json", "blueprint.txt")
```

### Solver Evaluation

```python
import solver_eval

# Run comprehensive solver evaluation
results = solver_eval.evaluate_solvers()
solver_eval.save_results_to_csv(results)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Main Configuration (`config.json`)

```json
{
  "grid": {
    "default_width": 16,
    "default_height": 10
  },
  "machines": {
    "default_assembler": "assembling-machine-2",
    "default_furnace": "electric-furnace"
  },
  "pathfinding": {
    "allow_underground": true,
    "allow_splitters": true,
    "max_tries": 3
  }
}
```

### Recipe Data (`recipes.json`)

Contains all Factorio recipes with ingredients, crafting times, and machine requirements.

Custome recipes can be added to the file.

### Machine Data (`machine_data.json`)

Defines machine capabilities, crafting speeds, and transport specifications.

Can be adapted to include new machines with specialized I/O points.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Remark 

If you encounter an error while creating a module, it's most likely due to a missing asset for the item or machine you're trying to use. Only a selection of item assets and the most essential machine, inserter, and belt assets are preloaded.

To add new assets, simply copy the image from the Factorio Wiki and place it in the assets folder. Make sure all filenames are in lowercase and use hyphens `-` instead of underscores `_`.
